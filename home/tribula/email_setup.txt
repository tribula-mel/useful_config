The configuration could be made more complex with MTA. For some reason this
has not worked for me as of move to BB. The fetchmail can be configured to
work without an MTA, and the step #0 reflects this, making the step #1
optional.

0) Fetchmail configuration

poll mapi
proto imap
user "the_user"
pass "the_pass"
fetchall
ssl
limit 0
mda "/usr/bin/procmail -m /home/bopetrovic/.procmailrc"

1) Make sure the postfix (MTA) is up and running
   a) check for /etc/postfix/main.cf
   b) if not there:
      sudo echo "myhostname <hostname>" > /etc/postfix/main.cf
   c) sudo postfix status
   d) sudo postfix start
   e) telnet localhost 25

2) Make sure that procmail (MDA) is configured
   a) sudo apt-get install procmail
   b) For Postfix piping add to /etc/postfix/main.cf:
      mailbox_command = /usr/bin/procmail -a "$EXTENSION"
   c) create initial $HOME/.procmailrc file
      (a sample can be found in man procmail)
